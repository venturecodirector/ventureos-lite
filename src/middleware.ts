/**
 * Two jobs, in order: route the public surfaces, then gate everything else
 * behind a session.
 *
 * PUBLIC SURFACES (CLAUDE.md → Domain layout). The authenticated app is the
 * ROOT of ventureco.agency. Three prospect-facing surfaces are served by the
 * same Next app on their own subdomains:
 *
 *   audit.<domain>/<slug>  →  /share/<slug>    public website-audit report
 *   quote.<domain>/<slug>  →  /accept/<slug>   public quote acceptance
 *   meet.<domain>/<slug>   →  /book/<slug>     public booking page
 *
 * The authoritative, env-driven mapping lives in the Caddyfile, which knows the
 * real hostnames and marks each request with `X-Public-Surface`. Middleware
 * runs in the edge runtime, where `process.env` is inlined at BUILD time — so
 * it must not read hostnames from env itself. It honours Caddy's header and
 * falls back to the structural subdomain prefix, which needs no configuration
 * and works in local dev too.
 *
 * AUTH GATE. This is a cheap presence check on the session cookie so signed-out
 * visitors get a clean redirect instead of an error page. It is NOT the
 * security boundary: the cookie is signed by Auth.js and the token inside it is
 * resolved against the `sessions` table by `getActiveContext()` on every server
 * action and page. Forging a cookie gets you a redirect loop, not access.
