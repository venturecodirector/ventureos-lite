/**
 * Undo, as server-side inverse operations (playbook-v2 P7/2).
 *
 * The playbook is explicit that this must not be a client-side illusion, and
 * the reason is concurrency. If the browser remembers "put it back to
 * Contacted" and a colleague has since moved the lead to Replied, replaying
 * that memory silently overwrites their work — the undo would be a second,
 * invisible edit rather than a reversal.
 *
 * So an undoable action records three things:
 *   - the INVERSE: what to write, to which rows;
 *   - the EXPECTED state it left behind;
 *   - a label, for the toast.
 *
 * Undoing re-reads the rows, compares them against `expected`, and DECLINES if
 * anything differs. That is the whole design: an undo that cannot verify what
 * it is undoing is not an undo.
 *
 * Both the action and the undo are audit-logged (CLAUDE.md hard rule #8).
