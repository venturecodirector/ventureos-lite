/**
 * Audit categories and per-category subscores (P1/3c, 3d).
 *
 * The audit used to be a flat list of pass/fail lines and one number. That is
 * hard to act on: "72" says a site is weak, not WHERE it is weak, and a
 * prospect reading the public report gets a verdict without a shape.
 *
 * Every check now belongs to exactly one category and carries a weight. The
 * subscore for a category is the share of its weight that FAILED — same
 * direction as the overall opportunity score, where high means weak site and
 * therefore strong opportunity. Categories with no applicable checks report
 * null rather than 0, because "nothing to measure" is not "perfect".
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so the whole scheme is testable without a browser,
 * a network or a database.
