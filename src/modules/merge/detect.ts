/**
 * Finding duplicates (playbook-v2 P5/2). Pure — the confidence rules are the
 * whole feature, and they have to be provable without a database.
 *
 * Three signals, in descending order of certainty:
 *   1. the same TAX ID. An adószám identifies a legal entity; two rows carrying
 *      one are the same company, full stop.
 *   2. the same DOMAIN. Strong, but not certain — a holding company and its
 *      subsidiary can share a website.
 *   3. a FUZZY-SAME NAME. Suggestive only. "Danubia Kft" and "Danubia Kft."
 *      almost certainly are; "Alfa Bt" and "Alfa Kft" quite possibly are not.
 *
 * Nothing here merges anything. It produces candidates for a person to look at,
 * because the cost of a wrong merge is far higher than the cost of a duplicate
 * sitting in a list.
