/**
 * Mail provider interface (playbook-v2 P2b).
 *
 * Gmail is the first implementation; the interface exists so IMAP can be the
 * second without anything above it changing. That is not speculative — it is
 * the fallback if the OAuth consent screen ever moves from Internal to
 * External, where Gmail's restricted scopes need Google verification.
 *
 * Note what the interface does NOT expose: there is no "list everything" and no
 * "get mailbox". A caller can only ask for messages matching a query it built
 * from CRM data, which keeps the privacy boundary at the type level rather than
 * in a comment.
