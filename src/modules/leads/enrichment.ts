 *
 * A Google Places result carries a name, an address, a phone and a website. It
 * carries no email — Places simply does not have one, for any business, ever. So
 * a prospected lead arrived with an empty Email field and stayed that way, and
 * the obvious conclusion ("that is impossible, every company has an email") is
 * right about the company and wrong about the source.
 *
 * The email is on the company's own site, usually in a footer or an impresszum.
 * We are already fetching that page for its copy, already honouring robots.txt,
 * and already caching the result for thirty days — so reading the contacts out of
 * the same response costs nothing extra.
 *
 * READ FROM THE RAW HTML, not from the extracted text: `extractReadableText`
 * strips markup, and `mailto:` / `tel:` links live in the markup. That is why the
 * details were being thrown away by a function that had already downloaded them.
