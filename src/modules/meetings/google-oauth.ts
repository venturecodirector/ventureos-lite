 * ── WHY BOTH PROMPTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A host connects a business calendar meetings are written to, and then a
 * personal one so nobody books over a dentist appointment.
 *
 * `consent` re-asks for CONSENT, which is what makes Google return a refresh
 * token. It does not ask WHICH ACCOUNT. With one Google account signed into the
 * browser — the normal case — Google skips the chooser entirely and hands back
 * the same account; the callback finds its row by email and updates it. So
 * "Connect another calendar" went to Google, came back without error, and still
 * showed one calendar. The second calendar was not merely unconnected, it was
 * unconnectABLE, and its busy times never blocked a slot.
