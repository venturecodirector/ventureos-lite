/**
 * The notification catalogue (playbook-v2 P6/1).
 *
 * Pure: what can be notified about, who is allowed to receive it, which
 * channels are on before anyone chooses, and how one event is kept from
 * notifying twice.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT HERE. The playbook lists eleven kinds. Ten of them have a
 * real event in this codebase and are wired. Two do not, and inventing an
 * emitter for them would have produced a type that can never fire:
 *
 *   - "meeting cancelled" — nothing cancels a meeting. There is no cancel
 *     action and the Meeting model has no status or cancelledAt column, so
 *     there is no moment at which the notification could be raised. It needs
 *     the cancellation feature first.
 *   - "import failure" — CSV import validates and reports created/skipped
 *     synchronously in the dialog; it has no asynchronous failure to report
 *     later. MAILBOX sync failure does exist, so `sync_failed` covers that half
 *     of the playbook's "import/sync failures" and is named for what it is.
