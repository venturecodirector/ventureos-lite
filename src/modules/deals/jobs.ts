/**
 * Quarterly stage-probability recalibration (playbook-v2 P4/c).
 *
 * "Win/loss data updates stage default probabilities QUARTERLY as a Signal
 * Engine proposal (approval queue, min n=20) — never silently."
 *
 * Deterministic: no Claude call, no budget cost. The rate a stage actually
 * converts at is arithmetic, and asking a model to do arithmetic is how a
 * probability becomes a guess.
 *
 * What counts as a stage's record: every deal that has PASSED THROUGH it and
 * has since closed. We do not have a per-stage transition log, so the honest
 * proxy is the stage a closed deal sits in against the stages before it in the
 * pipeline — a deal that reached Negotiation and won also proves Qualified
 * converts. Reading only the terminal stage's own record would tell us the win
 * rate of Won (100%) and Lost (0%), which is no information at all.
