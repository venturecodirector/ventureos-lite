/**
 * A FUNCTION, not a static `metadata` object, for one reason: `metadataBase`.
 *
 * og:image has to be an absolute URL — a crawler has no page to resolve a
 * relative one against — and Next builds it by resolving the relative path
 * against `metadataBase`. A static export is evaluated at BUILD time, which
 * would bake whatever APP_URL the image was built with into every deployment's
 * link previews; the container is built once and run with a runtime env, so that
 * is exactly the wrong moment to read it. Same reasoning as the manifest route.
