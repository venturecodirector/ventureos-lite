 * Postgres Row-Level Security (belt-and-braces with the tenant guard).

 * Policies are keyed to workspace membership: a row is visible only when
 *   - its workspace_id equals the session GUC `app.current_workspace`, AND
 *   - the session GUC `app.current_user` is a member of that workspace.
 *
 * The app connects as a NON-superuser role (`app_user`) in production so RLS is
 * actually enforced (superusers bypass RLS). Set the two GUCs per transaction
 * with set_config(..., true). This module applies the role, grants and policies
 * idempotently; it is a no-op story on MySQL (which has no RLS — tenancy there
 * rests solely on the guard).
