 * question ("may this user do X?") and its callers wrap it in try/catch to turn
 * a denial into a friendly message. If this path redirected, `redirect()`'s
 * NEXT_REDIRECT signal would be swallowed by those catch blocks. No session
 * simply means no membership, which means no grant — a safe denial. Pages use
 * `getActiveContext()`, which redirects to /login.

 * different question, with a different scope, and one that must not be
 * answerable by anybody inside a workspace. If it were a role, an Owner (who
 * can already edit memberships) could grant it to themselves.
 *
 * So it is a column on the user that no UI writes. It is set on the server with
 * `scripts/set-super-admin.ts`, by whoever has the shell — which on a
 * self-hosted deployment is the operator, and that is the whole point.
