/**
 * Calling a Server Action from a client handler, without the silence.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Next.js redacts anything thrown out of a Server Action in production. The
 * client gets a bare Error carrying only a `digest` — no message, no stack. A
 * handler written as
 *
 *     startTransition(async () => {
 *       const res = await someAction(input);
 *       if (!res.ok) setMsg(res.error);
 *     });
 *
 * therefore fails COMPLETELY SILENTLY when the action throws rather than
 * returns: the rejection has no catch, the transition ends, the button flips
 * back from "Saving…" to "Save changes", and the operator is told nothing at
 * all. That is exactly what "the save does not work" looks like from a chair —
 * and it is indistinguishable from a dead button.
 *
 * Expected outcomes are still RETURNED as data (`{ ok: false, error }`), which
 * is the rule this codebase already follows. This is the net under the
 * UNEXPECTED ones, so that a bug shows up as a message instead of as nothing.
 *
 * The digest goes into the message on purpose: it is the only handle that
 * correlates what the operator saw with the line in the server log, and it is
 * not sensitive — it is a hash, which is precisely why Next.js sends it.
