 * worker containers — docker-compose mounts the `files` volume there. On a
 * developer machine nothing may create `/data`, so a host-side run of the
 * isolation spec (which writes a PDF to prove workspace B cannot read
 * workspace A's) died in beforeAll with ENOENT and took the other three
 * isolation tests down with it.
 *
 * Setting it HERE rather than in `.env` is deliberate: this is evaluated in the
 * runner process before any spec loads, so specs reading `process.env.FILES_DIR`
 * see it, and `webServer` inherits it — Next.js does not overwrite a variable
 * that is already present in the environment, so `.env` cannot clobber it. The
 * container path stays exactly as it was.
 *
 * `/data/` at the repo root is already gitignored.

   * specs create, filter, re-stage and delete leads — and in parallel they were
   * revalidating /leads underneath each other, so a worker could be served a
   * cached render that predated its own write. The failures moved around every
   * run, which is the signature of contention rather than of a bug.
   *

   * machinery for a suite of this size. Serial costs roughly two extra minutes

   * ── THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS, RATHER THAN A SHRUG ─────────────────────────────
   *
   * Across four full runs of the ~200-test suite, two or three tests failed each
   * time. Every single failure was a TIMEOUT, never an assertion; the identity of
   * the failing tests changed run to run; and every one of them passed when run
   * on its own or in a small group. That is the signature of the dev server
   * getting slower over a long session — it compiles routes on demand and holds
   * everything in one process — not of a defect in what is being tested.
   *
   * The honest fix would be to run the suite against a production build, but the
   * production env guard (correctly) refuses loopback and http origins, so a
   * local prod server cannot be started without lying to it.
   *
   * `retries: 1` does NOT hide anything: Playwright reports a test that only
   * passed on retry as FLAKY, separately from passed. A flaky line in the output
   * is a thing to investigate, and treating it as a pass is how a real
   * intermittent bug gets ignored.
