/**
 * Every captured field lands in its OWN column (capture item 2b).
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS IS ABOUT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The capture wrote `title: input.jobTitle ?? input.headline`. The Experience
 * section is lazy-rendered, so `jobTitle` is absent on most captures and the
 * headline silently took its place — and the lead form renders `title` in its
 * job-title input. On /in/mgoldberger the headline was itself the person's NAME
 * (a separate bug, item 1/2a), so the operator saw an empty Name field with
 * "Mark Goldberger" sitting in the job-title slot beside it.
 *
 * Two facts, two columns, and NEITHER substitutes for the other. A job title is
 * "VP Sales". A headline is "VP Sales @ Metaview | Startup Advisor and Investor |
 * Ramp and Navan Alum". A field with nothing captured stays empty.
