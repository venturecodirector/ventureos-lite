/**
 * The Hungarian profile that reported four problems at once (fixture h).
 *
 * A real capture came back with a headline, a location, a name and a photo URL —
 * and no company, no job title, no visible location and no avatar. Four separate
 * causes, none of which was the DOM extractor being wrong about the page:
 *
 *   COMPANY — the current employer IS in the top card, as PLAIN TEXT. All 45 of
 *   the page's `/company/` anchors sit outside the card, so looking for one inside
 *   it found nothing on every profile.
 *
 *   JOB TITLE — genuinely absent. The headline is "Data-driven Fan-engagement &
 *   Sponsorship Activation": no separator, no role vocabulary, and no Experience
 *   section mounted. Nothing to read, so nothing is claimed.
 *
 *   LOCATION — read correctly and then invisible: the form's only City input
 *   belongs to the company, so a lead with no company showed no location at all.
 *
 *   AVATAR — read correctly and rejected by the server: the app container could
 *   not write /data/files at all (root-owned volume, app runs as uid 1001).
