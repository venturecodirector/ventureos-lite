/**
 * The silence that looked like a broken button.

 * ── THE REPORTED PROBLEM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   "Lead szerkesztésekor a mentés nem megy"  — Save does nothing
 *   "Run research nem csinál semmit"          — Run research does nothing
 *
 * Neither was a dead button and neither was a refusal. Both were an UNEXPECTED
 * throw inside a Server Action, and Next.js redacts those in production: the
 * client receives an Error whose `message` is EMPTY and whose only content is a
 * `digest`. Two ways that reached the operator as nothing at all:
 *
 *   1. No catch — the rejection inside `startTransition` went nowhere, the
 *      button flipped back from "Saving…", and no message was ever set.
 *   2. `setError((e as Error).message)` — an empty string, and the error strip
 *      is rendered as `{error && …}`, so an empty string renders nothing.
 *
 * The first is why the save was silent; the second is why research was. They
 * are the same bug with two spellings.
